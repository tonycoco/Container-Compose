# Container-Compose

Container-Compose brings (limited) Docker Compose support to [Apple Container](https://github.com/apple/container), allowing you to define and orchestrate multi-container applications on Apple platforms using familiar Compose files. This project is not a Docker or Docker Compose wrapper but a tool to bridge Compose workflows with Apple's container management ecosystem.

> **Note:** Container-Compose does not automatically configure DNS for macOS 15 (Sequoia). Use macOS 26 (Tahoe) for an optimal experience.

## Features

- **Compose file support:** Parse and interpret `docker-compose.yml` files to configure Apple Containers.
- **Apple Container orchestration:** Launch and manage multiple containerized services using Apple’s native container runtime.
- **Environment configuration:** Support for environment variable files (`.env`) to customize deployments.
- **Service dependencies:** Specify service dependencies and startup order.
- **Volume and network mapping:** Map data and networking as specified in Compose files to Apple Container equivalents.
- **Extensible:** Designed for future extension and customization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Mac running macOS with Apple Container support (macOS Sonoma or later recommended)
- Git
- [Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/) (for building, if building from source)

### Installation

You can install Container-Compose via **Homebrew** (recommended):

```sh
brew update
brew install container-compose
````

Or, build it from source:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Mcrich23/Container-Compose.git
   cd Container-Compose
   ```

2. **Build the executable:**

   > *Note: Ensure you have Swift installed (or the required toolchain).*

   ```sh
   make build
   ```

3. **(Optional)**: Install globally

   ```sh
   make install
   ```

### Usage

After installation, simply run:

```sh
container-compose up
```

You may need to provide a path to your `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` file as arguments.

## Utilities

For guest-kernel swaps when testing SMB/NFS support with Apple `container`, this repo includes:

```sh
./scripts/setup-container-kernel.sh --binary /path/to/vmlinux --force
```

That script installs the kernel with `container system kernel set`, restarts the `container` services, and prints the configured kernel before and after the change.
